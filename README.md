# Magnetic-Navigation-System
* A magnetic navigation system(MNS) for the wireless manipulation of micro robots in human blood vessels is a possible
surgical tool for coronary artery disease  
* To generate uniform magnetic field & gradient, MNS composed of one conventional pair of Maxwell and Helmholtz coils
and one newly devel‑oped pair of gradient and uniform saddle coils  
* Through Optimization Algorithm, we design the proposed MNS generates a magnetic field or field gradient 22% stronger
on average than that of the conventional MNS with a sevenfold longer operating time limit, and the maximum three‑
dimensional rotating magnetic field is improved by 42%
